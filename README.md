Data generated for "The Effect of Centrifugal Force on Transmission Spectroscopy of Exoplanet Atmospheres"

A compressed JSON file containing the data generated for Figure 4 of the publication. It contains a grid of exoplanet bulk densities (in g/cm^3), Planet radii (in R_jup), Isothermal temperature of planet atmosphere (in K), Stellar radii (in R_sun), orbital periods (in days) a pair of transmission spectra for each grid point (one with the effect of centrifugal force included and one without), and a set of boolean values to indicate if the residuals between the two are above error limits of 30 ppm, 60 ppm and 100 ppm
